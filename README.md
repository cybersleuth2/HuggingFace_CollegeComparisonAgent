## Hugging Face - Agents Course - Unit 1

**How does it work:
User inputs up to 3 colleges in the prompt template. The College Comparison Agent makes an API call to https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/ and then outputs the comparison to the user screen.

**Known Issues:
- Agent hallucinates or data is not being pulled correctly
- Not all the comparison data points are being gathered in agent v1
- May add enhancements in the future to improve user interface
